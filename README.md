# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Github Blog âœ”

This project aims to function as a blog utilizing the GitHub API as an ICMS service, a challenge set forth by RocketSeat. Throughout this endeavor, I've significantly enhanced my skills, particularly in ReactJS.

One key aspect of this project was implementing a Context API in ReactJS. This allowed me to efficiently manage functions and variables that needed to be shared across the application. Additionally, I utilized the Axios library to facilitate requests to the GitHub API, ensuring seamless data retrieval and management.

Furthermore, I leveraged the Styled Components library to create distinct, customized components and manage their behavior effectively throughout the application's interface. This approach not only enhanced the visual appeal but also streamlined the development process by promoting component reusability and maintainability.
